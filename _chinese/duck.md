## Ingredients
- Half a packet of duck, defrosted slightly and cut into slices
- Chili oil
- 1 scallion chopped, whites and greens separated
- 2 tsp garlic
- 5-6 dried red chilies
- ~2 tbsp olive vegetable paste
- 1 tbsp shaoxing wine

## Steps
1. Cook duck in a little oil until slightly crispy and remove from pan.
1. Start pan with chili oil, scallion whites, garlic, red chilies, and olive vegetable paste
1. Add duck
1. Add shaoxing wine
1. When almost done, add scallion greens
1. Add more chili oil if needed


## Notes
- The duck has whey protein, so it's vegetarian but not vegan.
- In previous iterations, I've used some of: ginger, dark soy sauce, sesame oil,
  and frozen red chilies. Feel free to add those in as desired.

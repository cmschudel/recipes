## Ingredients
- 5 scallions, roughly chopped
- 60 (~38g) whole dried red chilies
- 25 peeled cloves (~85g) garlic
- 50g peeled and chopped ginger
- 6 tbsp szechuan peppercorn
- 10 star anise
- 3 tbsp cumin seeds
- 6 leaves bay leaf
- 2 tbsp black cardamom
- 2 cinnamon stick
- 2 tsp cloves
- 4 cups canola oil
- 1 cup asian red chili flakes

## Steps
1. Put ingredients except red chili flakes in small saucepan.
1. Heat up to 225 to 250 degrees F and keep at that temperature for at least 10-15 mins, making sure that none of the spices burn.
1. Allow to cool completely.
1. Strain out solids.
1. Heat oil back up to 200F.
1. Pour over container with red chili flakes and mix.
1. Allow to cool completely.

## Notes
- If you’re missing some of star anise through cloves, it’s fine to omit.
- I make this in a big batch and use this for ramen, mapo tofu, dry pot, and a
  couple other dishes. This doesn't work well as a standalone oil since it
  doesn't have any salt, so add salt if serving separately.

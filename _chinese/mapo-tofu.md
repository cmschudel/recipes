# Mapo Tofu

## Ingredients

- 14oz package of silken or soft tofu. Silken is harder to work with and more
  likely to break up than soft, but tastes a little nicer. Cut into 1-1.5"
  cubes. Preferred brand is Mandalay, which we get from Hong Kong supermarket in
  New York.
- 1 cup of dashi
- 2 tbsp and 2.5 tbsp chili oil
- Half of one large leek, chopped roughly
- 2 tbsp minced garlic
- 1 tbsp grated ginger
- 3 flat tbsp chili broad bean paste
- 1 tbsp fermented black beans, rinsed
- 10-20 dried red chilies
- 1.5 tsp Szechuan peppercorns
- 1.5 tbsp Szechuan peppercorns, toasted and thoroughly ground. Split into 2/3
  and 1/3.
- 1 tbsp cornstarch, mixed in 1.5 tbsp cold water
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp light soy sauce
- 1 tsp shaoxing wine
- 1 tsp dark soy sauce

## Steps
1. Start a wok with a 2 tbsp chili oil.
1. Add a few whole dried red chilies and 1.5 tsp szechuan peppercorns.
1. Add leek and cook until it just begins to soften. If it softens too much, it loses its texture in the final dish.
1. Add garlic and ginger and cook until raw smell goes away.
1. Add broad bean paste, black beans, 2.5 tbsp more chili oil, and 2/3 of the ground peppercorns, and mix.
1. Add sesame oil, light soy sauce, and shaoxing wine and mix.
1. Add the dashi.
1. Add corn starch.
1. Bring to a simmer so the corn starch activates.
1. Taste for adjustments. It’s easier to mix at this stage since the tofu isn’t in, so this is the best time to adjust. Generally do not need to make adjustments.
1. Add the tofu. Mix gently, pushing away from you to avoid breaking up the tofu. This is less of a concern with soft tofu than with silken tofu.
1. Continue to mix and let simmer for at least 5 minutes.
1. Taste and make adjustments (generally not needed).
1. Add the remaining ground peppercorns and serve

## Notes
- Be careful with any added salt - it’s quite salty without adding anything.
- If omitting light soy sauce and Shaoxing wine, consider adding an extra 1/2 tsp of sesame oil.
- We've tried a bunch of different variations of these. We tried included mushrooms (both processed to resemble ground meat and in bigger pieces), but found they didn’t work that well.
- We used to parboil the tofu with no-salt bouillon cube, but switched to dashi, which is much richer. Stopped parboiling after trying without and not having issues (the idea was that parboiling sets the tofu).

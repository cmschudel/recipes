## Ingredients
- 2kg red onions, cut roughly
- 4 tbsp garlic
- 2 tbsp ginger
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 2 tbsp red chili
- 4 tbsp coriander
- 1 tbsp cumin
- 2.5 cups canned tomato puree


## Steps
1. Saute onions with a little salt until translucent.
1. Add garlic and ginger
1. Once raw smell goes away, add the rest of the spices
1. Blend with 2.5 cups tomato puree until smooth.
1. Freeze in ~500g batches

## Notes
- You could cook down the tomato puree before blending and save some time when
  using the puree. However, this means that you'd have to wait for the paste to
  cool before you can blend it.

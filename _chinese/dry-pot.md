## Notes
- You’ll want to scale up/down the spices based on how many ingredients you end up using; I tend to do this by sight rather than e.g. measuring the volume/weight of the cooked ingredients I’m using.
- The fermented black beans and miso pastes are substitutes based on what I had on hand when I first tried making this, so you could probably omit or replace with something based on the recipes below to get something more authentic. I liked the taste with them, so never bothered purchasing other ingredients afterwards.
- Tamarind paste was to add a bit of acidity, can be omitted

## Based on:
- Old Mala Project menu - they had a rough recipe on there in the paste

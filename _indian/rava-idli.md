## Ingredients
- For the batter:
    - 1 cup rava
    - 1/4 cup yogurt
    - 1 cup water
    - 3/4 tsp salt
    - 1 tsp ginger
    - 1 tsp lemon juice
    - Tempered oil (see below)
    - 3/8 tsp baking soda
    - Idli chili powder
- For tempering:
    - 1.25 tsp mustard seeds
    - 1 tsp cumin seeds
    - 1 tbsp chana dal, rinsed
    - 1 tbsp urad dal, rinsed
    - Handful of cashews, chopped
    - 2 green chilies
    - 7-8 curry leaves
    - Small bunch of coriander leaves, chopped

## Steps
1. Add the rava, yogurt, water, salt, ginger, and lemon juice to a bowl and mix.
1. Add canola oil to pan and add the tempering ingredients one after the other, except
   the coriander leaves.
1. When the tempering is done, turn off the heat, quickly mix in the coriander
   leaves, and add the tempering liquid to the batter, mixing thoroughly.
1. Add the baking soda and mix gently.
1. Spray the idli racks with canola oil, and portion out the batter into the
   idli racks, adding a sprinkle of idli chili powder to each.
1. Steam for 14 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out cleanly.
1. Remove the idlies from the racks and serve.

## Notes
- Can use coconut oil instead of canola oil for tempering. That'll give the
  idlies a nicer color.

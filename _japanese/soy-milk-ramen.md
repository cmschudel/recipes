## Ingredients

### Broth and tare
- 4 cups soy milk
- 2 cups of [dashi]({{ "/chinese/dashi" | relative_url }})
- 2 tbsp sesame oil
- white parts, 4 scallions
- 2 tbsp minced garlic
- 1 tbsp ginger
- 2.66 tbsp broad bean paste
- 4 tsp red miso
- 4 tsp white miso
- 2 tsp tahini
- 3 tbsp shaoxing wine
- 2.66 tbsp soy sauce
- Dash of white pepper

### Noodles
- Our favorite brand is Sun noodles

### Toppings
Whatever you want. Cook separately.

### Aroma oil
I've recently been using my [chili oil]({{ "/chinese/chili-oil" | relative_url }})
for this. Another one I've made and enjoyed is a mushroom-scallion oil. But the broth
works well with a wide range of aroma oils so you can sub in any aroma oil
you want.

You'll want about a tablespoon of aroma oil for each bowl of ramen.

##  Directions

### Broth
1. Add sesame oil to saucepan on medium low.
1. Add garlic, ginger, and white parts of scallions.
1. Add miso paste and spicy bean paste, stirring constantly.
1. Deglaze with Shaoxing wine
1. Add soy sauce
1. Add soy milk one cup at a time and stir to incorporate.
1. Add 2 cups of the dashi.
1. Add white pepper.
1. Simmer gently, for a few minutes
1. Strain out the solid and save the broth.
1. Adjust to taste - it's generally fine as-is (including salt), so typically
   don't need to make any adjustments.

### Noodles
1. Cook according to package directions. Time this so the noodles finish last,
   when you're assembling.

### Assembling
1. Warm bowls with boiling water, then pour out the water.
1. Ladle in desired amount of ramen broth.
1. Add noodles.
1. Add toppings.
1. Add ~1 tbsp of aroma oil per bowl (adjust to taste).

## Notes
- This is for about 4 servings.
- This follows [https://www.justonecookbook.com/vegetarian-ramen/](https://www.justonecookbook.com/vegetarian-ramen/) pretty closely,
  with just a few tweaks.
- Some other good reading (I didn't like some of these recipes, or they weren't
  vegan, but some of the discussion around techniques were interesting).

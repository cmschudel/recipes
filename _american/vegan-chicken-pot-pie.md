## Ingredients
- 1 medium yellow onion
- Few bay leaves
- 2 tbsp garlic
- 3 tsp of no-chicken bouillon
- 2 cups of water
- Veggies/"chicken" (e.g. 10 baby carrots, 3 small potatoes cubed, frozen peas, frozen
  spinach, frozen corn, may wah chicken)
- 1/3 cup of soy milk
- 4 tbsp flour
- Pepper

## Steps
1. Saute onions in olive oil.
1. Add bay leaves and garlic.
1. Once the raw smell goes away, add the water, bouillon, and soy milk
1. Add the vegetables in order of how much time they need to cook such that
1. Simmer until veggies are cooked
1. Whisk in flour one tbsp at a time to avoid lumps. Some people do this
   earlier, but I prefer to add it now so you can omit if you want to.
1. Add salt and pepper to taste. Can add water or soy milk here as needed, but I
   haven't had to.
1. If making with biscuits, I prefer to cook the biscuits separately and serve
   together to avoid it becoming soggy. If making in traditional pie crust, pour
   mixture into pie crust (slightly less done than you want it), and bake as
   needed for pie crust (e.g. 45 mins at 350).

## Notes
Based on [this](https://minimalistbaker.com/1-hour-vegan-pot-pies/) Minimalist
Baker recipe. Looked at a couple other vegan recipes but all were similar
(outside of using a regular crust). Tried it with biscuits and with a regular
crust, and preferred the regular crust.

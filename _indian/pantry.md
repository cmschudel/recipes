## Basic ingredients
<div>Basic spices you'll want for Indian food - this covers what you need for
most recipes:</div>
- Cumin seeds
- Cumin
- Coriander
- Red chili
- Turmeric
- Garam msala

There's certianly much more you'll want if you're cooking a lot of Indian food,
but that's a good starting piont.

Indian food also uses a lot of onion (red or yellow works for most recipes),
garlic, and ginger, so you'll want those on hand. We normally put garlic and
ginger in a food processor, and freeze them.  That way, we just have one
container of garlic and one of ginger in the fridge at any time.


## Helpful resources

I normally don't cook to someone else's recipe any more, but these were very
helpful when I was getting started. And if I'm looking to make something totally
new, I'll normally cross-check against a couple recipes for commonalities.
- [Vahchef](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_R8qIXaTKpkAJuuiZhHTmA) - has lots
  of recipes. The more recent videos are less helpful, but has a lot of good
  older videos
- [Kabita's Kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCChqsCRFePrP2X897iQkyAA).
  Good recipes. Videos are in Hindi (which I don't speak), but subtitles and
  video makes the approach pretty clear.
